# General Configurations

This currently contains just my Sublime Text customisation along with my version of Neovim's init.vim file
There's a lot of custom changes to be made in the future.

Changes with respect to Sublime Text: <br>
Vintage mode has been disabled, and there are a bunch of plugins I could install.
My personal key bindings and user settings I use have been uploaded into this repository. 
The theme I prefer is the agila theme and monokai colour scheme at the moment, though that probably isn't final.
Finally, there's a couple of key binding changes, such as setting "ctrl+shift+]" as unindent.
Also, "ctrl+[" enters normal mode at the moment, although some day I hope use the Caps Lock button to do it instead.

init.vim:
I currently use Plug as my package manager of sorts. Also, I've installed a few plugins just to make sure it works to an at least barebones extent.
Alongside this, I've added a bunch of custom bindings with the leader key. It just makes a lot of things more convenient for me now.
