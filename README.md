# Sublime-Text-Customisation

There's a lot of custom changes to be made, such as potentially enabling vintage mode.
Also, the personal key bindings and user settings I use have been uploaded into this repository.
The theme I prefer is the brogrammer theme and colour scheme at the moment, though that probably isn't final.
Finally, there's a couple of key binding changes, such as setting "ctrl+shift+]" as unindent.
