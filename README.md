# Sublime-Text-Customisation

There's a lot of custom changes to be made in the future.
Vintage mode has been disabled, and there are a bunch of plugins I could install.
My personal key bindings and user settings I use have been uploaded into this repository.
The theme I prefer is the agila theme and monokai colour scheme at the moment, though that probably isn't final.
Finally, there's a couple of key binding changes, such as setting "ctrl+shift+]" as unindent.
Also, "ctrl+[" enters normal mode at the moment, although some day I hope use the Caps Lock button to do it instead.
